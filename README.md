Description
-----------------
    A collection of commonly used small pieces of code that can be reused in a variety of projects
    
Overview
-----------------
    Please note: The well written code is most likely not written by me. :-)
    I could not credit all the sources, most of them are anonymous anyway. I can only say thanks a lot!
    However the folders 01-node-tutorial-john-smilga and 02-express-tutorial-john-smilga are almost identical copies 
    of the code provided by John Smilga at https://github.com/john-smilga/node-express-course for his really exceptional 
    Node.js and Express.js Full Course (which can be found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oe421EPjeBE&t=27031s).
    I have just extended a few bits and pieces, added a few lines and comments here and there in order to make it 
    a bit more understandable.
