Redux uses a special object called the store.   
The store acts as a container for state, it provides a way to dispatch actions, and it calls the reducer when actions are dispatched.   
In nearly every Redux application, there will only be one store.
### Data flow:

1. The store initializes the state with a default value.
2. The view displays that state.
3. When a user interacts with the view, like clicking a button, an action is dispatched to the store.
4. The dispatched action and the current state are combined in the storeâ€™s reducer to determine the next state.
5. The view is updated to display the new state.


- Create a Redux store
- Render the initial state of the application.
- Subscribe to updates. Inside the subscription callback:
        Get the current store state  
        Select the data needed by this piece of UI  
        Update the UI with the data  
 - Respond to UI events by dispatching Redux actions
