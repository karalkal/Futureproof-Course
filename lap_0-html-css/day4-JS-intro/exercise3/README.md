### Study Notes
[Logic in JavaScript](https://github.com/getfutureproof/fp_guides_wiki/wiki/Logic-in-JavaScript)

# Exercises
1. **Create a ternary that correctly returns a pluralised string** \
Create a program that takes two variables, “item” which is equal to the name of an item and “count” which is equal to the number of items I have. Create a ternary statement that returns a sentence as such ‘I have <count> <item>’’. However the word count and item should be replaced by the values in the variables and item should have a s on the end if there is more than one item.
  
2. **Patterns** \
Write a program that returns a string where every other character is a & followed by a blank space. Print out this string so that it forms a 10 x 10 grid which would look similar to this:
```
&   &   &   &   &
  &  &  &  &  &
&   &   &   &   &
  &  &  &  &  &
&   &   &   &   &
  &  &  &  &  &
&   &   &   &   &
  &  &  &  &  &
&   &   &   &   &
  &  &  &  &  &
```

3. **Pass the tests**
- Fork and clone this repo
- cd into the repo folder with `cd fp_study_notes_logic_in_JavaScript`
- Install dependencies with `npm install`
- Run the test suite with `npm test`
- Make changes to `main.js` until all tests are passing
- *BONUS*: Add more tests
