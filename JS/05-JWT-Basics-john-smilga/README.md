For this demo we have two routes - dashboard and login.
Only after a token has been created, the dashboard info can be accessed - in our case just a random number + a greeting with the name of the "logged in" user.
Register/Logging functionality is just a very basic sumulation - we only need to enter anything and a token will be created. 
Main functionality with issue of token is in controllers.
